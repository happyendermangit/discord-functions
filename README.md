# discord-functions
âœ¨A database of discord functions and how to find them using a string, useful for dataminers.âœ¨

## Why i made this?
Discord pushed an update to their client which renamed about every exports names, so i'm creating this so that you can still use these functions with their name

## ðŸš€ | Contributing:

- I'm looking for contributors, if you want to help, here is the info:

1. there is 2644 functions left
2. please avoid making the find_with use Endpoints.something because Endpoints isnt a valid export on the new build
3. [here you can find the functions](https://github.com/happyendermangit/discord-functions/blob/main/need_to_do_functions.json)

Example function:
```json
{
  "name": "camelCaseName",
  "find_with":"String That Will Never Change and is only on this function",
  "method": "findFunctionByCode"
}
```

## How to use this data:
- SOON:tm:
